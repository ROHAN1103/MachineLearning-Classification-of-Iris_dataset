# MachineLearning-Classification-of-Iris_dataset
  The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in machine learning and statistics, often used for classification and clustering tasks. It contains information about three species of iris flowers: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica. The dataset consists of 150 samples with the following features:
* Sepal Length (cm): Length of the sepal (numeric).
* Sepal Width (cm): Width of the sepal (numeric).
* Petal Length (cm): Length of the petal (numeric).
* Petal Width (cm): Width of the petal (numeric).
* Species: Target variable with three classes:
   1. Iris-versicolor
